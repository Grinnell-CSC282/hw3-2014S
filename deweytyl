# A script to move all .jpg files from current directory into a directory and put them in a directory named images.

# Create a directory called images, if one does not already exist.

mkdir -p images

# I got the idea to use the flag -p from Fiona's submission. 
# It's reasonable to assume that a user might want to run
# this script multiple times, and nowhere in the problem
# specifications did Sam say that the directory did not already
# exist.

# Change the permissions on all jpg files in the current directory
# so that they can be moved when we attempt to move them.

chmod 700 *.jpg

# I also got this idea from Fiona, but decided to use different
# syntax because I feel more comfortable with this.

# Move the files!

mv *.jpg ./images

# I got this idea from this page on askubuntu.com:
